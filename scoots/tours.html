                <h2>History of Cozumel Island</h2>
                <p>Tourists from far away places have been coming to Cozumel for a long time. Centuries before the
                    Spanish landed in 1518, during the height of the Maya civilization, Cozumel was an important trading
                    center and a place of pilgrimage. Maya women from the mainland came to worship Ix Chel, the wife of
                    the Sun God Itzamna and the Goddess of Fertility, to whom the island’s temples were dedicated. In
                    1519, Cortez arrived and destroyed many of the Maya temples. By 1570, small pox and other European
                    diseases had reduced the island’s population from a pre-Hispanic estimate of 40,000 to no more than
                    300. By 1600 the island was reportedly abandoned. In 1848 the island began to
                    be resettled by refugees from the “War of the Castes”, a Mayan uprising in the Yucatan against the
                    central Mexican government. By 1970, the population had grown to 10,000.Today, most of Cozumel’s
                    50,000 residents live in the town of San Miguel located on the western side of the island. Much of
                    the town’s social and business activity is focused on the central town square or Plaza del Sol.

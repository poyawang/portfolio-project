                <h3>After Years of Fighting, Idaho Retains Climate Change in Its Education Guidelines</h3>
                <p>By Livia Albeck-Ripka</p>
                <p>A years-long battle over whether Idaho would require its science teachers to teach about global
                    warming was resolved Thursday when the State Senate education committee voted to adopt standards
                    that included sections on human-caused climate change.
                    Idaho’s legislature had scrubbed all mentions of human-caused climate change from its teaching
                    standards last year. The State Department of Education then put forth revised standards, but this
                    month the House education committee voted to gut the supporting content, which was designed to help
                    teachers assign coursework and included multiple mentions of climate change. On Thursday, the Senate
                    committee approved the revised standards in full, including the supporting content, on a 6 to 3 vote
                    that drew support from both parties. Because both chambers did not agree to reject the standards,
                    they will go into effect.
                    State Senator Janie Ward-Engelking of Boise, a Democrat on the education committee, said the
                    supporting content was important to include. “When a new teacher comes in, they need to see all the
                    concepts that they’re responsible to teach,” Ms. Ward-Engelking said. “To be honest, it’s kind of
                    embarrassing that it’s been so controversial.”
                    Emily Her, 17, a senior at Timberline High School in Boise who started a petition and appeared with
                    her classmates at hearings to support the revised standards, said she was glad that all students in
                    Idaho would learn about climate change. “It was definitely a group effort, and I was really happy
                    that it paid off and that they decided to listen to us,” she said</p>
